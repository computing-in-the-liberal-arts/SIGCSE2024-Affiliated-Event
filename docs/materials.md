# Innovations and Opportunities<br>in Liberal Arts Computing Education

This page contains links to materials from the [SIGCSE 2024 Affiliated event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2024-Affiliated-Event/).  Some are materials that were submitted for review prior to the event, others were presented at the event, while others were generated collaboratively and dynamically during the event by participants.
