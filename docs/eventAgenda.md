**Lunch Break** (12:00 PM - 1:30 PM)

**Afternoon Session** (1:30 PM - 5:00 PM)

The afternoon session will focus on the ACM/IEEE/AAAI CS2023 draft curriculum model. Members of the Committee will lead a workshop based on a liberal-arts focused process they have developed for curriculum review and revision that balances institutional identity with external guidelines for CS curricula. Feedback from this session will inform both the process under development and the Committee’s advocacy efforts with the ACM/IEEE/AAAI curriculum task force.

* **Workshop Overview and Introduction to Identity-Focused Curriculum Design and Review** (1:30 PM - 2:00 PM)

* **Guided Sessions with “A Workbook for Liberal Arts Computer Science”** (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM)

  * Session participants will be grouped based on experience with curriculum revision, institutional context, and personal interest. Each group will be paired with a session facilitator and will work collaboratively through the first three steps of the process workbook. Participants are encouraged to have a laptop available for this work. Materials will be shared online and participants will be able to take the results of their work back to their home institutions for discussion or continued work.
